Course Description
------------------

Tired of doing electromagnetism like it's 1865?

Find out what solid-state physics has brought to Electromagnetism II (8.02 or 8.022) in the last 20 years, in this new course surveying the physics and mathematics of nanophotonics - electromagnetic waves in media structured on the scale of the wavelength.

In this regime, which is the basis for everything from iridescent butterfly wings to distributed-feedback lasers and integrated optical devices to the next generation of optical fibers, the 140-year-old analytical techniques you learned in Electromagnetism II aren't very useful. Instead, we will cover computational methods combined with high-level algebraic techniques borrowed from solid-state quantum mechanics: linear algebra and eigensystems, group theory, Bloch's theorem and conservation laws, perturbation methods, and coupled-mode theories, to understand surprising optical phenomena from band gaps to slow light to nonlinear filters.

Prerequisites
-------------

Advanced Analytic Methods in Science and Engineering (18.305) or permission of instructor. (Basically, some experience with partial differential equations and linear algebra.) This is a graduate-level course aimed at beginning graduate students and suitably advanced undergraduates.

Texts
-----

Joannopoulos, John D., Steven G. Johnson, Robert D. Meade, and Joshua N. Winn. _Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light_. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780691124568.  
This book is at an undergraduate level, and 18.369 is somewhat more advanced, but the book should provide a useful foundation. You can [read the book online](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book/).

Useful (but not required) books for this course:

Inui, Tetsuro, Yukito Tanabe, and Y. Onodera. _Group Theory and Its Applications in Physics (Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences)_. 2nd corrected ed. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, February 1996. ISBN: 9783540604457.

Tinkham, Michael. _Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics_. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2003. ISBN: 9780486432472.

Homework
--------

Problem sets are assigned on a roughly weekly basis and are worth one third of the total grade. The collaboration policy on homework is as follows:

First, talk to anyone you wish, and read anything you wish (with the exception of homework solutions from previous terms, which are strictly **verboten**). In fact, you are encouraged to discuss the course material and the homework problems with your classmates - often the best way to learn something is to force yourself to explain it to someone else. However, **before** you discuss a homework problem with a classmate or look for related information in some reference, you are expected to first make a solid effort at it on your own.

Second, **after** you discuss a homework problem with a classmate or read related information in some other reference, you must write up the solution on your own, in your own words, starting from something close to a blank sheet of paper.

Exams
-----

There is one midterm exam that covers the first half of the course. There is no final exam, but there is a final project due at the end of the course.

Project
-------

Students must choose a published paper on an interesting photonic-crystal phenomenon, replicate the results of that paper using the MIT numerical software, and then extend the results in some interesting way. Students must write one 5-10 page paper based on their project.
