description: Lecture notes intended as a brief introduction to the theory and practice
  of perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundaries for wave equations, intended
  for future use in the courses 18.369 and 18.336 at MIT. It focuses on the complex
  stretched-coordinate viewpoint, and also discusses the limitations of PML.
